            <p>Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Xenia is backed by mainstream investments. The benefit of this approach is that investors are aware that even though there will be fluctuations in the value, it will not be drastic because it is based on the fluctuation of real-world assets. These assets are selected by the Six38ppn.com team using a strategic asset allocation strategy to ensure that the risk is reduced while maintaining a reasonable growth potential. </p>

          <p>Xenia con is a highly liquid coin because a liquid investment portfolio backs it. This makes it resilient against economic shocks.</p>

          <h1>The Xenia ICO</h1>
          
          <p>Raising funds for the Xenia Coin will be done through a crowd funding approach. An ICO and Pre-ICO will be used to raise funds for the platform.</p>

          <h3>ICO Goals</h3>
          <p>TThe total token supply of Xenia coins will be capped at 200 million tokens. Out of this 25 percent of the tokens will be allocated during the main ICO. An additional 10 percent is set aside for the cost of the ICO, 7.5 will be used to support the project while the remaining 67.5 percent will be reserved in escrow. The main aim of the ICO is to raise funds for the development of the platform.</p>
          
          <h2>ICO particulars</h2>

          <h4>Target amount of Fundraised</h4>
          <p>TBD based upon Fiat Currency needs & Current Value of Bitcoin & Ethereum</p>

          <h4>Use of Proceeds</h4>
          <p> 90 percent for asset raiding, platform development, and sponsor investor while 10 percent will be for the cost of the ICO</p>

          <h2>Use of the proceeds</h2>
          <p>The platform development and mobile applications has been initialized and in most part completed by the investment of the founder as such 90 percent of the proceeds from the ICO will be used in  acquiring assets that will back the coin. Development of the platform entails the creation of the different smart contracts, the Xenia coin, and blockchain. Additionally, the development of the mobile applications is ongoing, the e-wallet, the pre-paid cards have been concluded and the most of the services are in development. The platform will also acquire the assets required to peg the Xenia coin. This will provide extrinsic value to the cryptocurrency as opposed to other digital currencies that are only intrinsic. The remaining 10 percent will be used to offset the cost of the ICO. This involves marketing costs and running the bounty program.</p>


          <h2>Invest in the ICO</h2>
          <p>Since Xenia coin is an ERC-20 token, you will need to have an e-wallet that can support the token. Six38ppn will send the Xenia tokens to the same account that sent the money to purchase the token. There will be a public key presented on the platform once the ICO is launched. All you need to do is register for an account and send an equivalent amount to the public account. In moments, you will receive the Xenia tokens allotted to you through the same e-wallet and for fiat payments after a KYC approval your token will be funded to the designated wallet. This will prevent people from stealing the tokens of others. </p>

          <h2>Caveat Emptor</h2>
          <p>Make sure that you only send money to the public account provided on the official site. There are a lot of scammers who have been taking advantage of ICO campaigns to steal from unsuspecting individuals. DO not rely on information from third-parties or social media sites. Ensure you only follow the instructions on the official site.</p>
